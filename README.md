# BrainModeling_NeurodegenerativeDiseases
In our project, we implement a computational brain modeling framework to simulate and compare three brains: one aﬀected by Alzheimer ’ s disease (AD), another aﬀected by Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and one that is healthy.

we employ a “MiniBrain” model targeting disease-vulnerable regions by exploiting the Wilson-Cowan neural mass dynamics and a severity parameter (α) to control diseases’ eﬀects.
